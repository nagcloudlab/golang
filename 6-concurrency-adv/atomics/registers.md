# CPU Registers

Major types of computer registers in the microprocessor are:

- `Memory Address Register` (MAR)
- `Stack Control Register` (ACR)
- `Memory Data Register` (MDR)
- `Flag Register` (FR)
- `Accumulator Register` (AC)
- `Instruction Pointer Register` (IPR)
- `Data Register` (DR)
- `Address Register` or `Segment Register` (AR or SR)
- `Memory Buffer Register` (MBR)
- `Index Register` (IR)
- `Program Counter` (PC)

### Memory Address Register or `MAR`

This Register is used to hold memory addresses from data and instructions.
The purpose of this Register is to access data and instructions from RAM during
the execution process of instructions. For example, the CPU needs to store some data in RAM,
or vice versa. When it wants to retrieve data from RAM.
MAR stores that data temporarily. Because if MAR did not do this,
the CPU wonâ€™t know where the instructions should be stored in RAM.
So logically, there is a registry called MAR.

### Stack Control Register or `SCR`

A stack is a set of a memory location in which data is stored and retrieved in order.
This order is called Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). The data item stored at the top of the stack
is retrieved before retrieving the item below it. Furthermore, stack control registers are used
to manage the stack inside the computer.

Two special registers SP and BP are used for this purpose.
DI, SI, SP, and BP can either be used as 2-byte registers or 4-byte registers.
The names of 4-byte stack control registers are EDI, ESI, ESP, and EBP.

### Memory Data Register or `MDR`

This type of Register is considered to be the most important CPU registers.
The MDR register is like  the CU unit register of the processor and stores information
that must be stored in the system RAM or other memory. MDR also contains data that can be fetched
or already fetched from a storage device.

The MDR register works like a buffer and holds a copy of information shifted from RAM to the register
during the `Fetch` operations being processed by the CPU.

### Flag Register or `FR`

Flag registers are used to indicate a particular condition. The size of the flag register
is one or two bytes. Each byte of flag registers is further divided into eight bits.
Each bit of the flag register indicates a flag or condition.

In addition, the data in the flag register is stored in 8 distinct bits.
Some flag registers are Zero flags, Carry flag, Parity flag, Sign flag, and Overflow flag.

### Accumulator Register or `AC`

The function of accumulative registers is to handle mathematical and logical operations.
These registers are part of ALU. Almost, there are four types of
accumulative registers called EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX.
The size of these registers can be 1 to 4 bytes.

The two-byte data registers (AX, BX, CX, DX) contain two parts of an 8-bit size.
Furthermore, these parts are separately accessible.
The lower order bytes are designated as AL, BL, CL, and DL.
The high-order bytes are designated as AH, BH, CH, and DH.

### Instruction Pointer Register or `IPR`

The instruction pointer register is used to store the memory location of the next instruction
to be executed. It is a special register that holds a sequence of instructions to be performed.
It almost works along with the segment registers.

### Data Register or `DX`

This type of CPU register is used to store data read or written from storage devices temporarily.
In technical terms, The  Data Register is also known as DX.

### Address or Segment Register or `AR` / `SR`

The address or segment register is used to store the memory location of the instruction that
is being executed. This is a group of 4 or 6 registers of two bytes named CS, DS, ES, and SS, FG, GS.
These registers are used with either the IP register or 2 `index` registers DI and SI.

### Memory Buffer Register or `MBR`

This Register stores the contents of data or commands that are read from memory or written to it.
In other words, the function of this register is to store data or instructions that are called
from memory or loaded on it. The MBR register is similar to the MDR register,
and they are no different at all.

### Index Register or `BX`

The purpose of this register is to store numbers or values in the processor that can be minus from
or included as a part of the address of an instruction to transform it into an effective and
efficient address. The Index Register is sometimes called the Base Register.

Index Register is generally a registry within a computer processor which functions
to change operand addresses during the execution of a program. 
In technical terms, Index Register is also called BX.

### Program Counter or `PC`

The Program Counter called PC for short is also known as the Instruction Pointer or IP.
This register is often pronounced as the Instruction Address Register.
This register stores the address memory path of the instruction which is going
to be processed after the current instruction is finished successfully.

In other words, the function of this Register is to contain the memory address of
the next instruction until the current instruction processed successfully.
